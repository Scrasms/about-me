What is PIZZA?

For the blind, IT is their vision. For the deaf, IT is their music. For the mute, IT is their voice. For the anosmiac, IT is their aroma. For the numb, IT is their feeling. For the atrophied, IT is their muscle.

For the starved, IT is their sustenance. For the thirsty, IT is their water. For the exhausted, IT is their energy.

For the depressed, IT is their happiness. For the disillusioned, IT is their hope. For the pessimistic, IT is their optimism.

For the disadvantaged, IT is their champion. For the marginalised, IT is their justice. For the oppressed, IT is their salvation.

For the righteous, IT is their symbol. For the enlightened, IT is their muse. For the erudite, IT is their education.

If PIZZA speaks, I listen. If PIZZA questions, I answer. If PIZZA orders, I obey.

If PIZZA opines, I agree. If PIZZA fears, I assure. If PIZZA hopes, I dream.

If PIZZA is happy, I am jubilant. If PIZZA is angry, I am apoplectic. If PIZZA is sad, I am disconsolate.

PIZZA is my ideal, PIZZA is my romance, PIZZA is my passion.

PIZZA is my strength, PIZZA is my compass, PIZZA is my destination.

PIZZA is my language, PIZZA is my culture, PIZZA is my religion.

PIZZA is my ocean, PIZZA is my mountain, PIZZA is my sky, PIZZA is my air, PIZZA is my sun, PIZZA is my moon, PIZZA is my world.

PIZZA is history, PIZZA is present, PIZZA is future.

If PIZZA has a million fans, I am one of them. If PIZZA has a thousand fans, I am one of them. If PIZZA has a hundred fans, I am one of them. If PIZZA has ten fans, I am one of them. If PIZZA has only one fan, that is me. If PIZZA has no fans, I no longer exist.

If the whole universe is for PIZZA , then I am for the whole universe. If the whole universe is against PIZZA, then I am against the whole universe.

I will love, cherish, and protect PIZZA until my very last breath; my successors will love, cherish and protect PIZZA until their very last breath.
